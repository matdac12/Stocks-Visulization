# Stocks-Visulization
Visualize updated NYSE Stocks Data

The code calls for Yahoo Finance Data. Can choose ticker name and time intervals. 

'tidyquant.R' contains the master code used to build the app. Fetches Yahoo Finance Data and returns a df with the chosen ticker data. We can then plot it. 

The rest of the files are the user interface and server side of the shiny app at this link https://mattiadacampo.shinyapps.io/stocks_app/
